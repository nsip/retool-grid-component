# Fix Verification Test - Version 70

## üéØ TESTING OBJECTIVE
Verify that the universal response propagation bug has been fixed in Version 70.

## üîß THE FIX
Fixed the `updateResponses` function to use current `configString` state instead of stale `config` object. Added console logging for debugging.

## üìã QUICK TEST STEPS

### 1. Refresh Component
1. In Retool, refresh the page to get Version 70
2. Component should still show "üîß Stable Grid (Unified Structure)"

### 2. Test Checkbox Grid (CRITICAL)
**Set gridConfig to:**
```json
{"type":"checkbox","rows":["Question 1","Question 2"],"columns":["Option A","Option B","Option C"],"responses":{}}
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Click some checkboxes
2. Watch "Current Responses" update ‚úÖ (should still work)
3. **NEW**: Check that `gridConfig.value` now contains the updated responses ‚úÖ
4. Open browser console - should see "Updating config with new responses:" logs

**Expected Result:**
`gridConfig.value` should now show something like:
```json
{"type":"checkbox","rows":["Question 1","Question 2"],"columns":["Option A","Option B","Option C"],"responses":{"Question 1":{"Option A":true}}}
```

### 3. Test Radio Grid (CRITICAL)
**Set gridConfig to:**
```json
{"type":"radio","rows":["Question 1","Question 2"],"columns":["Yes","No","Maybe"],"responses":{}}
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Select some radio buttons
2. Watch "Current Responses" update ‚úÖ
3. **NEW**: Check that `gridConfig.value` now contains the updated responses ‚úÖ

### 4. Test Textbox Grid (CRITICAL)
**Set gridConfig to:**
```json
{"type":"misc","rows":["Name","Email","Comments"],"responses":{"Name":"","Email":"","Comments":""}}
```

**Test Steps:**
1. Type in text fields
2. Watch "Current Responses" update ‚úÖ
3. **NEW**: Check that `gridConfig.value` now contains the typed text ‚úÖ

## üéâ SUCCESS CRITERIA

**PASS**: All three grid types now update `gridConfig.value` with user responses
**FAIL**: Any grid type still shows empty responses in `gridConfig.value`

## üîç DEBUGGING

If the fix doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for "Updating config with new responses:" logs
2. If no logs appear, the `updateResponses` function isn't being called
3. If logs appear but `gridConfig.value` doesn't update, there's a Retool state binding issue

## üìä EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX

### Before Fix (Version 69)
- ‚úÖ Display updates correctly
- ‚ùå `gridConfig.value` stays unchanged

### After Fix (Version 70)  
- ‚úÖ Display updates correctly
- ‚úÖ `gridConfig.value` updates with responses
- ‚úÖ Unified structure maintained
- ‚úÖ Console logs show update activity

**Ready for Testing**: Version 70 deployed with universal response propagation fix
