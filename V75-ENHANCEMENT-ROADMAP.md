# V75+ Enhancement Roadmap

## ‚úÖ V74 CURRENT SUCCESS
All tests successful! StableGrid component is now:
- Deployed as version 74
- Inspector panel working
- State variable binding working
- Programmatic control working
- **External state access working** - `stableGrid1.currentResponses` accessible in JavaScript
- **Backend integration ready** - Perfect for JavaScript-based data processing
- No crashes or React rendering errors

## üéØ V75+ ENHANCEMENT OBJECTIVES
Gradually enhance StableGrid to provide advanced grid functionality while maintaining V74 stability.

### Phase 1: Enhanced Grid Types
- [ ] Add support for nested text boxes within grid cells
- [ ] Implement mixed input types (checkbox + text, radio + text)
- [ ] Add validation and error handling for complex configurations

### Phase 2: Advanced Configuration
- [ ] Support for conditional fields (show/hide based on other selections)
- [ ] Multi-level nested structures
- [ ] Custom styling and layout options
- [ ] Field dependencies and validation rules

### Phase 3: Enhanced Programmatic Control
- [ ] Read individual cell values programmatically
- [ ] Set specific cell values without full grid refresh
- [ ] Event handlers for individual field changes
- [ ] Bulk operations (clear all, select all, etc.)

### Phase 4: API Enhancement
- [ ] Create comprehensive API functions for all operations
- [ ] Add helper functions for common use cases
- [ ] Implement data transformation utilities
- [ ] Add debugging and logging capabilities

## üîß TECHNICAL APPROACH
1. **Incremental Development**: Add one feature at a time
2. **Test Each Addition**: Ensure stability after each enhancement
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep existing functionality working
4. **Safe Rendering**: Use `safeStringify()` pattern for all new features

## üìã CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES TO SUPPORT
```javascript
// Simple grid (already working)
{
  "type": "checkbox",
  "rows": ["Q1", "Q2"],
  "columns": ["A", "B"]
}

// Grid with text inputs (V75+ goal)
{
  "type": "mixed",
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "label": "Question 1",
      "fields": [
        {"type": "checkbox", "label": "Yes"},
        {"type": "text", "label": "Comments", "placeholder": "Enter details..."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

// Nested structure (future goal)
{
  "type": "nested",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section A",
      "rows": [...],
      "subsections": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ V75+ DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION
1. V74 StableGrid provides stable foundation with external state access
2. All testing infrastructure is in place
3. Deployment pipeline working (version 74)
4. Safe rendering patterns established
5. **Backend integration patterns proven** - JavaScript context works perfectly

## üìÅ KEY FILES FOR V75+ DEVELOPMENT
- `src/index.tsx` - Main component (StableGrid function - V74)
- `stablegrid-api.js` - API functions to enhance
- `V74-WORKAROUND-TEST-GUIDE.md` - External state access testing patterns
- `V74-DETAILED-SETUP-GUIDE.md` - Current setup procedures
- `FINAL-STABLEGRID-SOLUTION.md` - Current working solution

## üéØ V74 BREAKTHROUGH CONTEXT
The V74 external state access breakthrough means:
- **JavaScript Integration**: `stableGrid1.currentResponses` works perfectly for backend integration
- **Event System**: `onResponsesChanged` provides real-time notifications
- **Production Ready**: Current solution handles the primary use case (backend integration)
- **Enhancement Foundation**: V75+ can build on this stable, working base

---
**Goal: Build advanced grid features on the proven V74 foundation while maintaining external state access and backend integration capabilities.**
