# Tomorrow's Development Roadmap

## ‚úÖ TODAY'S SUCCESS
All tests successful! StableGrid component is now:
- Deployed as version 68
- Inspector panel working
- State variable binding working
- Programmatic control working
- No crashes or React rendering errors

## üéØ TOMORROW'S OBJECTIVES
Gradually enhance StableGrid to match DynamicControl's full functionality while maintaining stability.

### Phase 1: Enhanced Grid Types
- [ ] Add support for nested text boxes within grid cells
- [ ] Implement mixed input types (checkbox + text, radio + text)
- [ ] Add validation and error handling for complex configurations

### Phase 2: Advanced Configuration
- [ ] Support for conditional fields (show/hide based on other selections)
- [ ] Multi-level nested structures
- [ ] Custom styling and layout options
- [ ] Field dependencies and validation rules

### Phase 3: Enhanced Programmatic Control
- [ ] Read individual cell values programmatically
- [ ] Set specific cell values without full grid refresh
- [ ] Event handlers for individual field changes
- [ ] Bulk operations (clear all, select all, etc.)

### Phase 4: API Enhancement
- [ ] Create comprehensive API functions for all operations
- [ ] Add helper functions for common use cases
- [ ] Implement data transformation utilities
- [ ] Add debugging and logging capabilities

## üîß TECHNICAL APPROACH
1. **Incremental Development**: Add one feature at a time
2. **Test Each Addition**: Ensure stability after each enhancement
3. **Maintain Compatibility**: Keep existing functionality working
4. **Safe Rendering**: Use `safeStringify()` pattern for all new features

## üìã CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES TO SUPPORT
```javascript
// Simple grid (already working)
{
  "type": "checkbox",
  "rows": ["Q1", "Q2"],
  "columns": ["A", "B"]
}

// Grid with text inputs (tomorrow's goal)
{
  "type": "mixed",
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "label": "Question 1",
      "fields": [
        {"type": "checkbox", "label": "Yes"},
        {"type": "text", "label": "Comments", "placeholder": "Enter details..."}
      ]
    }
  ]
}

// Nested structure (future goal)
{
  "type": "nested",
  "sections": [
    {
      "title": "Section A",
      "rows": [...],
      "subsections": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üöÄ STARTING POINT TOMORROW
1. Current StableGrid is stable foundation
2. All testing infrastructure is in place
3. Deployment pipeline working (version 68)
4. Safe rendering patterns established

## üìÅ KEY FILES FOR TOMORROW
- `src/index.tsx` - Main component (StableGrid function)
- `stablegrid-api.js` - API functions to enhance
- `STEP-3-STATE-VARIABLES.md` - Testing patterns to follow
- `FINAL-STABLEGRID-SOLUTION.md` - Current working solution

---
**Goal: Gradually transform StableGrid into a full-featured dynamic control while maintaining the stability we achieved today.**
