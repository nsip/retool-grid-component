# StableGrid Inspector Panel Test - Step 1

## DEPLOYMENT STATUS
âœ… **Updated to version 68** with fixed React object rendering

## STEP 1: Add StableGrid Component
1. Open your Retool app
2. Add a Custom Component
3. Select "DynamicControlLibrary"
4. Choose "StableGrid" from dropdown
5. Component should appear without "dead computer icon"

## STEP 2: Test Inspector Panel ONLY
1. Select the StableGrid component
2. Look at Inspector panel on the right
3. Find "Grid Config" field
4. Enter this EXACT JSON in the Inspector field:

```json
{"type":"checkbox","rows":["Q1","Q2"],"columns":["A","B","C"]}
```

## EXPECTED RESULT:
- Grid should display as a checkbox grid
- 2 rows (Q1, Q2) and 3 columns (A, B, C)
- Checkboxes should be clickable
- No crashes or "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors

## IF IT WORKS:
- Inspector panel control is confirmed working
- Ready for next step (state variables)

## IF IT FAILS:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify you're using version 68 of the library
- Try refreshing your Retool app
- Verify you selected "StableGrid" not "DynamicControl"
