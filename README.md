# Retool Grid Component - CCL Component Detection Issue

This repository contains a Retool Custom Component Library (CCL) project that demonstrates a critical issue with component detection in CCL v2.

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: CCL consistently produces an empty component manifest despite valid component code, preventing the component from appearing in the Retool sidebar menu.

## Technical Details

- **CCL Version**: Latest (updated during debugging)
- **Component Type**: React component with forwardRef and useImperativeHandle
- **Export Pattern**: Named export `export { DynamicControl }`
- **Build Status**: ✅ Builds successfully
- **Deploy Status**: ✅ Deploys successfully (creates new versions)
- **Component Detection**: ❌ Always produces empty manifest

## Manifest Issue

The generated `dist/retool-custom-component-manifest.json` consistently shows:
```json
{
  "customComponentSupportVersion": "2",
  "components": {}
}
```

Expected behavior: Should contain component definitions.

## Evidence of Intermittent Detection

Terminal history shows that at certain points, the manifest was 225 bytes (indicating successful component detection), but it consistently reverts to 62 bytes (empty components object).

## Component Implementation

The component includes:
- `setValue(newValue)` - Sets component state and triggers onChange
- `getValue()` - Returns current component state  
- `clearValue()` - Resets component to default state

These methods are exposed via `useImperativeHandle` to work across iframe boundaries.

## Files

- `src/index.tsx` - Current component implementation
- `src/index.tsx.backup` - Original working version
- `src/index-final.tsx` - Clean version without debug code
- `src/1` - Known working component file (also fails to detect)

## Debugging Attempts

1. ✅ Tried multiple export patterns (named, default, library object)
2. ✅ Updated CCL to latest version
3. ✅ Tested with exact copy of previously working file
4. ✅ Used both dev mode and direct deployment
5. ✅ Verified component code builds without errors

## Conclusion

This appears to be a fundamental CCL infrastructure issue rather than a component code issue, as even known working component files fail to be detected by the current CCL build process.
