# StableGrid Component - Final Working Solution

## âœ… DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE
- **Status**: Successfully deployed as version 68
- **Component Name**: StableGrid
- **Library**: DynamicControlLibrary
- **Issue Fixed**: React object rendering error resolved

## ðŸ”§ Problem Solved
The original issue was "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {columns, rows})" which occurred when Retool passed JSON objects directly to the component instead of strings. This has been completely resolved.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
1. **Safe Object Rendering**: Added `safeStringify()` function to handle all data types safely
2. **Flexible Input Handling**: Accepts both JSON strings and objects from Retool
3. **No Crashes**: Eliminates "dead computer icon" errors
4. **Inspector Panel Support**: Works with Retool's Inspector panel
5. **Programmatic Control**: Supports state variable binding for JavaScript control

## ðŸš€ Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Add Component
1. Open your Retool app
2. Add Custom Component â†’ DynamicControlLibrary â†’ StableGrid
3. Component should render without errors

### Step 2: Test Inspector Panel
Enter this JSON in the "Grid Config" field:
```json
{"type":"checkbox","rows":["Q1","Q2"],"columns":["A","B","C"]}
```

### Step 3: Test Programmatic Control
1. Create state variable `gridConfig` (string type)
2. Bind StableGrid's "Grid Config" to `{{ gridConfig.value }}`
3. Use JavaScript query:
```javascript
gridConfig.setValue(JSON.stringify({
  "type": "checkbox",
  "rows": ["Question 1", "Question 2"],
  "columns": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C"]
}));
```

- âœ… Grid displays correctly
- âœ… Checkboxes are clickable
- âœ… No React rendering errors
- âœ… Inspector panel updates work
- âœ… Programmatic updates work
- âœ… Component remains stable

2. **No component crashes**: âœ… Fixed with safe rendering
3. **Inspector panel functionality**: âœ… Working
4. **Stable deployment**: âœ… Version 68 deployed successfully

## ðŸ”„ Migration from DynamicControl
If you were using the problematic DynamicControl component:
1. Replace with StableGrid in your Retool app
2. Update any existing bindings to use the new component
3. Test with your existing data structures
4. Use the provided API functions for programmatic control
