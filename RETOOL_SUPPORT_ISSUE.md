# Retool Support Issue Report

## Issue Type
Custom Component Library (CCL) - Multiple Critical Issues

## Priority
Critical - Complete development workflow failure

## Summary
Multiple interconnected issues with CCL v2 preventing custom component development:
1. Component detection failure (empty manifests)
2. Historical deployment failures 
3. Component updates not propagating to Retool interface
4. Intermittent build/deploy success without actual functionality

## Environment Details
- **CCL Version**: Latest (updated during debugging session)
- **Node Version**: >=20.0.0 (as specified in package.json)
- **Operating System**: macOS
- **Retool Instance**: [Your Retool instance URL]

## Issue History & Timeline

### Historical Problems
- **Past Deployment Failures**: Previously experienced issues getting `npx retool-ccl deploy` to work at all
- **Intermittent Success**: `dev` and `deploy` commands have occasionally succeeded in the past
- **Component Update Lag**: Even when deployments appeared successful, components did not update in Retool interface
- **Recent Complete Failure**: Component has not updated in Retool for several hours despite multiple successful deployments

### Current Session Issues (Last Few Hours)
- Successfully deployed 7 versions of the library (versions 1-7)
- All deployments report "Updated code received by Retool ‚úÖ"
- Zero components appear in Retool sidebar menu
- Component manifest consistently empty despite valid code

## Detailed Problem Description

### What Should Happen
1. Run `npx retool-ccl build` ‚Üí Component detected in manifest
2. Run `npx retool-ccl deploy` ‚Üí Component updates in Retool
3. Component appears in sidebar menu for app development
4. Changes propagate to Retool interface within reasonable time

### What Actually Happens
1. ‚úÖ `npx retool-ccl build` completes successfully
2. ‚ùå Generated `dist/retool-custom-component-manifest.json` is always empty:
   ```json
   {
     "customComponentSupportVersion": "2", 
     "components": {}
   }
   ```
3. ‚úÖ `npx retool-ccl deploy` reports success
4. ‚ùå Component never appears in Retool sidebar menu
5. ‚ùå Library versions increment but no functional changes occur

### Evidence of System Instability
From terminal history analysis:
- **17:59:01**: Manifest was 225b (successful detection)
- **17:59:11**: Manifest dropped to 62b (empty) 
- **18:02:07**: Manifest was 225b again (successful detection)
- **18:02:58**: Manifest remained 225b
- **18:06:46**: Manifest dropped to 62b (empty)
- **Current**: Consistently 62b despite identical code

This pattern indicates systemic instability in the CCL build/detection process.

## Component Code Structure

The component follows standard CCL patterns and has been tested with multiple variations:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { useState, forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from "react";

const DynamicControl = forwardRef(function DynamicControl({ config, onChange }, ref) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(config || { rows: [], columns: [], type: null, responses: {} });

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    setValue: (newValue) => {
      setState(newValue);
      if (onChange) onChange(newValue);
    },
    getValue: () => state,
    clearValue: () => {
      const cleared = { rows: [], columns: [], type: null, responses: {} };
      setState(cleared);
      if (onChange) onChange(cleared);
    }
  }));

  // Component render logic...
});

export { DynamicControl };
```

## Comprehensive Debugging Performed

### 1. Export Pattern Testing
- ‚úÖ Named export: `export { DynamicControl }`
- ‚úÖ Default export: `export default DynamicControl`
- ‚úÖ Library object: `export const AlchemerImitiation = { DynamicControl }`
- ‚úÖ Combined approaches
- ‚úÖ Component metadata: `DynamicControl.displayName = "DynamicControl"`

### 2. CCL Environment
- ‚úÖ Updated to latest CCL version: `npm update @tryretool/custom-component-support`
- ‚úÖ Clean rebuilds: `rm -rf dist/ && npx retool-ccl build`
- ‚úÖ Both dev and deploy modes tested extensively

### 3. Code Validation
- ‚úÖ Tested with exact copy of previously working component file (`src/1`)
- ‚úÖ Even known working files now fail to be detected
- ‚úÖ Multiple component file versions created for comparison
- ‚úÖ TypeScript errors resolved

### 4. Build Process Analysis
- ‚úÖ `npx retool-ccl dev` - Creates versions but no component detection
- ‚úÖ `npx retool-ccl deploy` - Reports success but no functional changes
- ‚úÖ Manifest file size monitoring (62b = empty, 225b = detected)

## Package.json Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "retool-dynamic-control",
  "version": "0.1.1",
  "main": "src/index.tsx",
  "retoolCustomComponentLibraryConfig": {
    "name": "AlchemerImitiation",
    "label": "Alchemer Imitiation", 
    "description": "Alchemer controls",
    "entryPoint": "src/index.tsx",
    "outputPath": "dist"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tryretool/custom-component-support": "^1.8.0"
  }
}
```

## Recent Build/Deploy Outputs

### Successful Build (Empty Manifest)

### Successful Deploy (No Effect)

```

### Version History
- Deployed versions 1-7 in current session
- All report successful deployment
- Zero functional changes in Retool interface
- Component library shows version updates but no components

## Impact Assessment

### Development Completely Blocked
- ‚ùå Cannot use custom components in Retool applications
- ‚ùå Cannot test setValue/getValue methods implemented for iframe communication
- ‚ùå Cannot validate component functionality
- ‚ùå Entire custom component development workflow non-functional

### Historical Context
- This represents an escalation of previous intermittent issues
- What were once occasional problems are now consistent failures
- Suggests degradation in CCL infrastructure reliability

## Repository & Evidence

**https://github.com/nsip/retool-grid-component**

Repository includes:
- Multiple component file versions
- Complete terminal history showing intermittent detection
- Package.json configurations tested
- Comprehensive documentation of debugging attempts

## Specific Requests for Retool Support

1. **Infrastructure Investigation**: Why is component detection intermittent and now consistently failing?

2. **Deployment Pipeline**: Why do successful deployments not result in component updates in Retool interface?

3. **Manifest Generation**: What causes the manifest to alternate between 225b (working) and 62b (empty)?

4. **Version Propagation**: Why do library versions increment without functional changes?

5. **Historical Context**: Has there been recent changes to CCL infrastructure that could explain the degradation?

## Urgency Justification
This issue represents a complete failure of the custom component development workflow. The intermittent nature and recent degradation suggest systemic issues that may affect other CCL users.

## Additional Evidence
Terminal logs show clear pattern of instability:
- Same code produces different manifest sizes at different times
- Successful deployments with zero functional impact
- Component detection appears to be environmentally dependent rather than code-dependent
